<h2>Star Devourer</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's about a spacial shifting being, you must complete the collection of items to stop shifting and save your life.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The shifting mechanic and the randomly generated objects you need to collect.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about timers and collision, I really wanted to know how to deal with collision.
The hardest part of the making it was the collision, I tried to have seperate groups of collision with different interactions but that is going to have to be for another time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all my assets with After Effects, I really want to polish this game in the future and put in actually good assets, I was going for the Stargazer theme so I want to make
the background have beautiful stars in it and not just the blackness of space and collection of star pieces.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Games that closely resembles mine is honestly any game where you collect things in a time limit, I don't think I've ever played a body shifting mechanic game that wasn't player controlled.

Phaser Borrows: Collision, Timer, and debugging text for the top of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You must collect pieces of a shattered star to stablize your body from shifting and eventual death.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used stargazer, I can't wait to do more with assets to really bring that theme to life.
As well as caught! because you must catch the pieces, but its not them whos moving its you.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: You body shifting and placement of the star pieces
Genre: Overhead and Racing (against time)
Play Style: Collector is all I used, (Storyteller is going to be apart of it, when we can start polishing games)

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Character Shifting
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to have fun with it and enjoy the soon to be visual update.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You move around with the mouse, you must collect the square star pieces laying around to stop your body from shifting and eventual death.
The gameplay that is not in the prototype will be manouving puzzles in a timely manor.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Remembering where you are in space, I might put in a coordinate system and make the map a little larger.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The character is a space traveler who got sucked into a portal and can't stop phasing around reality.
Nothing makes the visuals interesting atm: to be continued.
Tokens represent Star pieces.
The tension of a time limit and not knowing where you're going to be next is a key factor.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Rouge-like players who like something different each time. (Again, in polish I'm hoping for objects that help you in your journey)
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Two minutes is the longest you can go before you die. (Death not included)
</li>

</ul>
