<h2>Decision</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>WARNING:</strong>
I have not been able to figure out the scoring mechanic still!
</li>

<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The rewards are set by the parents and the content of the game is deteremined by the parents.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The reactive button to text highlight.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned alot about buttons and json format.
The hardest part was the question answering portion to match what the correct answer was to the button clicked. Since the questions were ever changing.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my assets from scratch and used some the graphics package from phaser
<li>Loading screen: Professor Gingold : I still forgot to make one</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Games that closely resembles mine is honestly any game where you collect things in a time limit, I don't think I've ever played a body shifting mechanic game that wasn't player controlled. Phaser Borrows: Collision, Timer, and debugging text for the top of the screen.
<br>
<br>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="iter2_dig_1">Iteration 2: Digital 1 (Former Assignement)</a></li>

		<li>I have added all the question</li>
		<li>The answers now highlight when selected</li>
		<li>There is a win state, but it only shows lose at the moment</li>
		<li>I added more graphics in the menus and game.</li>

	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A decision making game that focuses on topics wanted by the parents.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is all through buttons.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Parental maniuplaiton of the games content and reward system.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A time of learning with a sweet reward at the end of parents choice. In the next iteration there will be a list to choose from and a custom input.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
First the parent will boot up the game and go to Parental Set-up and choose the categories they want the child to go through. Next the child will then press Start, having 10 seconds per question. They will have three answers to choose from, they will just click one, the correct answer hopfully. At the end of the game there will be the final score to see if they won and recieve their reward. This game is meant to be played once a day, so rewards cannot become crazy.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Using around 8 of the 10 seconds to make the decison so they have a solid confidence in their choice, but enough time to answer while choosing the correct one.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is different, it is an educational tool mixed with a reward system
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Children and Guardians together, this game does not work without that dynamic)
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
5 minutes, with all the 10 second questions and with all the 30 second questions.
</li>
