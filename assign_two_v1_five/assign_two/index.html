<ul>

<li>
I tried to use P2 but I couldn't get it to work with everything I needed to do. This is a lowest grade project I'm going to be using that gets thrown away grade wise.
There was a bunch of other programming assignments this week. Next weeks game is going to done in the Arcade package and a real game and not just a character and movement. I couldn't
get platforms in P2 to work.
</li>

<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The jump mechanic to be explained below.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
You only get four jumps and then you must reset where you get shot down towards the ground when you reset your jumps with the tab key.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that p2 is not the physics engine to use for what I wanted to do for this game.
The easiest is the art, cause its super simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All my prototype assets I made by myself with the real helper of After Effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I wanna be the guy, or it is going to be when refined. I borrowed P2 physics engine code for attaching it to my character, when moving that character I also used P2 example update function code. Not much for more .bodymove() fn.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A barn burner death run! (because you're a chicken.. in a barn)
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
platformer, keyboard, storyteller.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The jump reset mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Puzzle solving thoughts usnig jumps.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
W is jump
A is left
D is right
S is down

E is a jump reset.

You get four jumps and then must reset to jump more. When you do reset do it when you're not above danger or you could die.
When pressing E to reset your jumps you hurtle towards the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Jump timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Its suppose to take place in a barn, the character is a chicken and his name is Todd. There are no tokens only level beating.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages that like a cutsey but hard game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Not very long at the moment.
</li>
