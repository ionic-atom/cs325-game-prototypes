<h2>Rock Collection</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a prototype for a puzzle game where you put the rocks where they need to go.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The mirror movement of the rocks in perspecitive to the character.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned 2d movement, spritesheets, and a lot of stuff dealing with animations.
Getting the mirror movement right, my first algorithm was off so it set me back.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my prototype assets in After Effects.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed /input/key.js and heavily modified as well as /sprites/spritesheet.js. On the spritesheet code there was very little modification.
My prototype does not resemble much, but what I'm hoping to do it resemble a box slider game where you have to get the correct pattern to win.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
It's a prototype for a puzzle game where you put the rocks where they need to go.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Geologist
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Mirror movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
