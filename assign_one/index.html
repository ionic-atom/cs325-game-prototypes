<h2>Rock Collection</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a prototype for a puzzle game where you put the rocks where they need to go.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The mirror movement of the rocks in perspecitive to the character.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned 2d movement, spritesheets, and a lot of stuff dealing with animations.
Getting the mirror movement right, my first algorithm was off so it set me back.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my prototype assets in After Effects.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed /input/key.js and heavily modified as well as /sprites/spritesheet.js. On the spritesheet code there was very little modification.
My prototype does not resemble much, but what I'm hoping to do it resemble a box slider game where you have to get the correct pattern to win.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
It's a prototype for a puzzle game where you put the rocks where they need to go.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Geologist
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is block like movement, the screen background in board like so its like moving pieces around a real board.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Mirror movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Pattern mind strengthening and fun addicting puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The inputs are left, up, right, and down using: left_arrow, up_arrow, right_arrow, and down_arrow respectively.
There are many things not in this prototype, I would like to impliment barriers and pits instead of other sprites that you need to put your "rock followers" into.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Lining up rocks; this is currently not in the game since rocks stack at the moment.
Boundary hugging; placing your character next to a wall to have the rock that is mirrored to you also be on a wall to get past blocks.
Etc; hopfully more strategies once I impliment more of this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
My world is a field of rocks that need to be collected by The Collector, he's a green guy who just loves his rocks. When they travel too far he has to go retreive them and put them back in his collection.
There are tokens in the form of rocks that need to be collected to win.
This is a very light-hearted game but after the prototype it will be light-hearted with very challenging puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers who need a game to play on the go.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Prototype: About 20 seconds
After prototype: Depends on level.
</li>
